    Distributed data service using Ray for parallel processing of time series queries.

    Automatically partitions large time series queries across Ray workers for horizontal scaling.
    The service splits queries by time windows and processes them in parallel, streaming results
    back as they complete.

    Args:
        base_service: The underlying data service to distribute
        ray_address: Ray cluster address (None for local Ray)

    Examples:
        Basic distributed processing:

        >>> service = StockDataService()
        >>> distributed = DistributedTimeSeriesService(service)
        >>> params = StockDataParams(
        ...     symbol="AAPL",
        ...     start_time=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
        ...     end_time=datetime(2024, 2, 1)  # 1 month of data
        ... )
        >>> async for batch in distributed.aget_batches(params):
        ...     process_batch(batch)

        With specific Ray cluster:

        >>> distributed = DistributedTimeSeriesService(
        ...     service,
        ...     ray_address="ray://head-node:10001"
        ... )

        Process flow for large query:
        1. Query: Jan 1-31 stock data (44,640 points)
        2. Auto-partition into 8 tasks (based on available workers)
        3. Distribute across Ray cluster:
           - Worker1: Jan 1-4   (5,580 points)
           - Worker2: Jan 5-8   (5,580 points)
           - Worker3: Jan 9-12  (5,580 points)
           - ...
        4. Stream results as tasks complete
        5. Total time: ~30 seconds vs 5 minutes single-threaded

    Architecture:
        Client → DistributedService → Ray Workers → Results Stream
                      ↓ partition query
                      ↓ submit remote tasks
                      ↓ stream results async

    Performance Benefits:
        - Linear scaling with worker count
        - Memory efficient streaming
        - Automatic load balancing
        - Fault tolerance via Ray
